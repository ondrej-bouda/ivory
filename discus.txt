Refactor Column
===============
* Currently, Column is both the pair of name and type, and an accessor to data. Thus, it needs a link to the relation it
  belongs to, to be able to get the data. Which might hint an overloaded class.



Nested Transaction Method Naming
================================
* Revise the Nested Transactions point in the feature plan.
* Are the method names OK? Other suggestions for the term instead of "block"?



DataSource
==========
* Would DataSource be useful?
* Would an analogy for Command be useful?
