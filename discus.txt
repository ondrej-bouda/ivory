* The default is asynchronous connecting.
** Because why not?
** But isn't it more expected for Ivory::connect() to return once it is really connected?
   Wouldn't Ivory::startConnecting() tell more what's going on? - Although, in case of asynchronous connecting, Ivory
   automatically waits until the connection is ready, so it is pretty transparent, and startConnecting() would, on the
   other hand, suggest some extra work has to be done.

* Connection::__destruct() calls disconnect()
