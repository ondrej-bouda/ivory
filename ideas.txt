autogenerate:
* data types
* relations for tables, views, table functions
* relation constants - read from the relation data

The generator will have a configuration script saying:
* what kinds of objects to generate
* what objects to generate (custom filtering possible)
* where to search (which schemas)
* how to recognize the relation constants (if ever)



Supporting PostgreSQL features:
* SQL available to the user in its full strength.
* Communication with the database server encapsulated in an object-oriented interface:
** asynchronous queries
** transactions
* Writable views, not only tables.
* Leveraging constraints info - e.g., unique keys are useful for intelligent UPSERTs.
* Prepared statements.



INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE:
* solve the simple CRUD operations with something like active record
* offer the RETURNING variants, e.g., updateReturning(), which would return a relation
* also implement more complicated operations, such as UPSERT
